```

## Usage

After installation, you can scaffold a new project by running:

```bash
create-node-spark my-new-project
```

This command will create a new directory called `my-new-project` with all the necessary files and folders.

For more information on the command-line options, you can run:

```bash
create-node-spark --help
```

## Project Structure

When you scaffold a new project, you will see the following structure:

```
my-new-project/
